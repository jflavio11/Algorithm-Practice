### Algorithms practice in Kotlin
---

I created this repository in order to practice the main data structures and algorithm exercises to have a better analytics thinking and problem solving skills.

The main packages are:
- *dataStructures*: data structures definitions and implementations with real life examples.
- *exercises*: practices divided by levels easy, medium and hard. Google-coding-interview like exercises.
- *sortAlgorithms*: the main sorting algorithms


#### Feel free to add a pull request with your algorithm exercise, data structure or sorting algorithm implementation .
